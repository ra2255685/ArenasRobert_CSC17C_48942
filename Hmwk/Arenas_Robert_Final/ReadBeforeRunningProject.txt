I included this file to let you know that i was not able to properly 
implement problem number 6 it does function but for reasons i cold not solve the 
shortest bath goes in the opposite direction of which i need ed it to go 
it goes bos mia lax instead of bos sfo lax which would actually be the.
i would appreciate it if you could give me feed back on what i was doing wrong on 
this problem by contacting me at rarenas1@student.rcc.edu i really want to know why my 
approach was wrong.

thanks in advance

also i only implemented a skeleton of e=what i actually wanted to do on problem 3 
because i had planned to come back to it after finishing problem 6 but that took muchlonge than 
i anticipated.

one last thing the initials.txtt is required for problems 1 and 5.
